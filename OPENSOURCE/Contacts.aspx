                    This is where you can find information about the developers, leaders, helpers, etc. If you have time and would like to help with //OS, contact someone on this page and they can set you up with some tasks and permissions. Also, any recommendations can be sent to anyone on this page. Oh, and just kidding about blaming these guys. They did this on their free time.<p>
